Created a Javascript Quiz application where the user starts the application by clicking the "Start Quiz" button and is presented with the first randomized question and answer set. Upon clicking "Start Quiz" a timer is also started. Each time the user answers a question correctly, they are notified on the screen. Each time the user answers a question incorrectly, they are notified and the time remaining is reduced by 10 seconds. When either the time runs out or all questions are answered, the user is taken to a screen where they can input initials for a high score. Once the users hits submit, the high score screen is displayed. the user can also access the high screen from the start page by clicking the words high score in the top left corner of the screen. Currently, the high scores are listed in the order they were inputted, not ranked by score, something I hope to add in the future.
